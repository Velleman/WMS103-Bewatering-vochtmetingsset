# WMS103- Auatomatice Watering and moisture measurment kit
Automated Watering and Moisture Measurement Set for Plants:

This set ensures that your plant maintains the ideal moisture level through a soil moisture sensor that is inserted into the potting soil of your plant.

If the moisture level is too low, it will activate a (peristaltic) pump that, in turn, pumps water to water the plant. Thanks to the water level sensor placed in the water supply container, the pump will never operate if the water level is too low. If it is low, an alarm will sound via a buzzer.

The OLED screen displays the moisture value as well as the status of the water level sensor.

With a button, you can manually operate the peristaltic pump if the water level is sufficient.

The set includes a template to create a plant pot holder from the packaging box, as well as a connection diagram for connecting all the electronic components to the Arduino.

The included Arduino is pre-programmed, and the source code can be downloaded above. You can also download the included connection diagram and template here.
